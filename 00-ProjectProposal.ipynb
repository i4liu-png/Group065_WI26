    "Understanding patterns of college admissions and representation is essential for evaluating equity in public higher education. Within the University of California (UC) system, admissions policies play a major role in shaping student demographics and access to academic opportunities. UC San Diego (UCSD), as one of the most selective public universities in the United States, serves as an important case study for examining representation among groups such as first-generation and international students. Public UC admissions datasets provide information on enrollment trends by residency status, ethnicity, gender, and academic interest, allowing researchers to analyze how institutional policies and broader social factors influence student representation.</a><a href=\"#ref2\">2</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A major historical influence on UC admissions policies is Proposition 209, passed in 1996, which prohibited the consideration of race, ethnicity, or sex in public university admissions. This policy significantly altered admissions strategies across the UC system and remains central to discussions about educational equity. Research conducted by the University of California Office of the President indicates that universities adopted alternative diversity strategies after Proposition 209, including expanded outreach efforts, holistic application review, and increased emphasis on socioeconomic factors. These changes demonstrate the importance of examining how demographic representation has evolved following major policy reforms.<a href=\"#ref1\">1\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical research has explored the long-term effects of Proposition 209 and access-oriented admissions policies on underrepresented students. Studies suggest that while overall access to UC campuses has expanded, demographic representation across campuses and academic disciplines remains uneven, particularly among historically underrepresented minority groups.<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a> Additionally, recent reporting indicates increasing enrollment of California residents alongside growth in international student populations, reflecting shifting institutional priorities and financial considerations.<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a> Educational policy discussions also highlight ongoing barriers faced by California students, including disparities in academic preparation, access to counseling resources, and financial constraints that disproportionately affect first-generation applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on prior research, this project examines the demographic distribution of first-generation and international undergraduate students admitted to UC San Diego between 2018 and 2023. By analyzing how these populations intersect across ethnicity, gender, and intended major categories, this study aims to provide a clearer understanding of how admissions policies and institutional trends influence student diversity at the campus level. Focusing on UCSD allows for a more detailed evaluation of representation across academic disciplines and contributes to broader discussions about accessibility and equity in public higher education.\n",

    "We hypothesize that there are distinct patterns across first generation, undocumented, and international students admitted to UC San Diego(2018-2023) across ethnicity, gender, and intended major. Specifically, due to cultural and economic factors, we believe that first generation and International will share considerable concentration in STEM-based majors, and that first generation will have a disproportionate percentage of underrepresented ethnicities while international students will show a different distribution of ethnicities and genders. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that the focus on STEM majors is influenced by economic stability. International students have increased costs due to travel and education expenses which may incentivize financial predictability with potential of high return when picking a major. Similarly, first generation students may prefer STEM as there is a higher financial floor and increased opportunities following graduation. On the other hand, first generation students may be disproportionately underrepresented ethnicities due to historical disparities in K-12 education, college counseling, and opportunity. International students have differing constraints which come in the form of restrictions of certain countries to send students to the US as well as socioeconomic differences across the world.  \n"

One table shows all of the ethnicities of the first year admits, whereas a different table shows the distribution of gender across the first year admits. They also have a table showing the distribution of majors across those admitted students. Unfortunately all of this data is aggregated data and there is no data set that contains every single admit individually. \n",

    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",

    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
